#Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing
A web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP created utilizing an external API called MeaningCloud to interact with their NLP system. This tool will help in classifying the information present in the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.
Webpack will be utilized as a build tool, with the purpose to set up the app to have development and production environments, each with its own set of tools and commands, besides that, Webpack will be used to supply service workers set up in order to provide the offline functionality of our app. Node and express will be employed for the webserver and routing. Additionally, Jest will be used to perform unit tests on our JavaScript functions.
